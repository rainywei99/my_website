My name is Rainy. I was born and raised in Beijing. I graduated from Northwestern this past spring by double-majoring in Econ and Stats, and I just started at London Business School in September to study a Masters in financial analysis. I’ve first become interested in finance by listening to news podcasts and understanding the connections between current events and the different sectors of financial markets. In the past couple of years, I’ve completed several internships across investment banking and private equity investor relations including UBS and Hillhouse. What I enjoyed the most was working in a fast-paced environment where I get to closely watch the markets, learn from the leaders within different industries, and understand how bankers serve as a bridge between companies and investors.
