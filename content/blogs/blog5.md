title: Graduation trip to California
---

My friends and I took a road trip to California after graduation. We flew to San Francisco first and then drove all the way to LA. Some of my favorite spots along the way include Half Moon Bay, 17-mile Drive and Santa Monica. It's a perfect way to say goodbye to my time in the US.
