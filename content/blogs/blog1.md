title: My Journey at London Business School
---

I'm currently enrolled in a 1.5 year masters program in Financial Analysis at LBS. LBS has always been ranked as one of the world's most elite business schools. I've always wanted to travel around Europe and UK is the perfect place to continue my academic journey while travelling in free time. 
The MFA program provides a rock-solid grounding in state-of-the-art financial tools, financial markets and global business understanding. Balancing theory with practice and real-world business exposure, LBS provides me with the chance to connect with international institutions and practitioners and build an international network.
