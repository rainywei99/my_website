title: My Northwestern years
---

The years I spent at Northwestern are among the most memorable of my life.
Located in Evanston, IL, USA, Northwestern is a comprehensive research university that is deeply interdisciplinary across multiple schools and units. Northwestern provides a rigorous yet empathetic academic environment with a robust mixture of theory and practice and an emphasis on top-tier research, new knowledge, creative expression and practical application. During my four years, I studied Economics and Statistics, while minoring in Art History. 
If you are at Northwestern, you are part of an innovative, collaborative, and multidimensional community delivering an impact that is rare in higher education.
