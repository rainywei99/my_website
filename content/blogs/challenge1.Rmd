# Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor).
The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian. 


```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"

# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )
```


```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
colors = c("black", "brown4", "deepskyblue4", "goldenrod3", "blue4", "green4")

#Quickly delete the columns we will not be using for plotting:
polls <- as.data.table(german_election_polls)
polls[,1:4 := NULL] 
polls[,11:12 := NULL]
polls[,c("fw", "others", "lead") := NULL]

#Reshape the data for multi-column plotting:
polls <- melt(polls, id="end_date")

#Do the plotting. We start with printing out the distinct poll results, then adding the simple MA to the graps:
ggplot(polls, aes(x = end_date, y = value, colour = variable)) + 
geom_point(alpha = 0.4, cex = 1.15) + 
geom_ma(aes(x = end_date+12), ma_fun = SMA, n = 14, position = "identity", linetype = "solid", size = 0.65)+
#Ensure the color scheme is aligned with the original plot:
scale_color_manual(values = c(colors)) + 
#Add the horizontal line grid:
geom_hline(yintercept = seq(5,45,10), linetype = "dotted", size = 0.5, color = alpha("grey", 0.5))+
#Delete the default grid:
theme_bw()+
theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), legend.title = element_text(colour = "grey", size = 1))+
#Finally, make the axis labels match the original plot
scale_x_continuous(name = "Polls end date", breaks = as.Date(c("2021-01-01", "2021-03-01", "2021-05-01", "2021-07-01", "2021-09-01"), "%Y-%m-%d"), labels = c("Jan 2021", "Mar", "May", "Jul", "Sep")) +
scale_y_continuous(name = "Percentage of votes cast", breaks = seq(5,45,10), labels = c(5,15,25,35,"45%"), limits = c(4,46))
