#As discussed in Slack, there are some issues with weeeks 53/1 around January the 1st of each year. Let's try fix it:

  }
}
bike <- bike %>% filter(year %in% c(2016:2021)) #since we don't really need earlier periods

#Let's start with the first graph:


#We will be working with dataset bike1 for the first plot
bike1 <- bike %>% 
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hired := mean(bikes_hired)) 
#Calculate monthly averages for 2016-2019 and assign them to bike1

  group_by(month) %>%

trend[1:nrow(bike1)] <- trend
bike1$trend <- trend

#Proceed to plotting:
ggplot(bike1, aes(x = month, y = mean_hired))+
  geom_line(aes(group=1))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin= mean_hired, ymax= ifelse(trend > mean_hired, trend, mean_hired), group = 1),
